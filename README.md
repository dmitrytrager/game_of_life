# game_of_life
Game of Live app for RubyConfIndia 2016 contest

immutable - tried to stick to functional approach
no if - only in comments =)

Run `rspec spec` to perform testing.
To start program itself run `./game_of_life ./seeds/base.txt`.

## Notes
Application looks quite complicated. For example, Cell class does not get much job. This is because of bonus challenges where I tried to achieve some goals.
